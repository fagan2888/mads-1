# MADS

Thought I'd write this up because this question gets asked repeatedly, but also because the answer does vary on your 
background so adjust accordingly. 

Current cohort: Fall 2019

Personal background: CS major undergrad. Most of my entire career involved little to no programming,
but true to everyone in finance generally, quite a lot of excel. My current job (which started the same time as MADS),
is actually quite programming heavy. I haven't used really used excel at all in the past year, which is kind of nice.

Python background: I had <1 month of python when I applied to the program (I found out about MADs in the first 
place while doing the Python 3 coursera...), so 6 months by the time I entered the program. Less than 6 of actual
practical experience, though, since I spent most of that time prior to the program interviewing for a new job.

Statistics background: Basic stats. I ended up focusing more on theory in my CS major to fulfill math requirements 
over applied courses. Still, probably sufficient for this masters, I guess? I just reviewed Statistics in Plain English
before I took the assessment. 

Other math courses taken: Single variable calculus, linear algebra, probability/combinatorics. Analysis of algos, etc. 

Family/work/lifestyle: Full time job, 50 hours/week, children, gym (1 hour a day). Early on, was also taking language
classes which stopped when Covid happened. 

General number of courses I take per month: I started at 1/month then switched to 2. Occasionally I'll drop to 1 if
my work/personal life is very busy for that month. 

SIADS 502 - Math Methods for Data Science
The first cohort had a disaster of a course the first time due to the ridiculous amount of bugs in this course. I have
mentally blocked out most of this course but I'm pretty sure the rest of the Fall 2019 cohort remember the meltdown I 
had halfway through with this after complaining about all four weeks' HW. Putting actual bug aside, relatively 
light course and relatively light math and light use of numpy. Some linear algebra, probability/combinatorics/stats, 
a bit of gradient descent. I remember exactly one question using multivariate calculus which I've never done but 
not exactly difficult to figure out if you've already  taken single variable. Took me about a week to finish all four 
assignments, if I remember rightly, but the rest of the month to complain about the fixes. Sorry Yumou, my first 
memory is arguing with you over the combinatorics problem. 

Workload: light

SIADS 503 - Data Science Ethics
Writing, reading AND video heavy course. You will end up watching those videos repeatedly. Weekly written assignments
and quizzes. I actually spent hours and hours on this course for the papers and never got a good sense of whether or not
I was going in the right direction. Strongly recommend having a partner in this course to help give you feedback on your
writing and vice versa. I personally find all writing assignments quite the time sink (this is true even at work, where
I wrote research reports for a living) because of format/direction/flow. If you are better at this, this may take up 
less time. 

Workload: heavy 

SIADS 505 - Data Manipulation
I actually took most of the Umich data science Coursera as well prior to starting the program and absolutely remember
trying furiously to finish the whole damn thing in a week because, well, the whole thing was free during the trial week. 
Failed largely because data manipulation course (the one that introduces pandas to you) took me a whole three days to 
finish, and then like, months afterward to even get comfortable. What helped was during my interview process for data 
analyst positions, I had to do a lot of jupyter notebook trials and they all had 24-48 hour turnaround times so getting 
extremely fast was a priority. This I think can be a timesink if you are new to pandas and even more of a timesink if 
you're new to programming. Strongly recommend taking the first or second data science Umich thing in advance if you can
since the format is very similar. Otherwise I found it doable. 

Workload: medium/heavy (on the lighter end of medium until assignment 4)

SIADS 511 - SQL and Databases
If you're familiar with SQL, then very easy. Postgresql variant, so just be warned everything you learn will not 
necessarily be generalizable to other dbs. Still, a very solid start. 

Workload: light

SIADS 515 - Efficient Data Processing
The first iteration had all 4 assignments hand graded. Relatively light workload if you meet the bare minimum. Otherwise
relatively light workload as some of it was review - e.g., generators, caching, profiling, code efficiency 
(discussion of big O notation) etc. I found it fun but was a relatively light workload - you can make it heavier 
by personally challenging yourself. 

Workload: light/medium

SIADS 516 - Big Data: Scalable Data Processing
Some discussion and playing around with mapreduce + spark. Working with spark in real life, I will tell you guys that 
you have it easy here. The hardest thing about Spark in real life is getting the stupid Spark session to connect,
especially if you have no one to help you - I have spent weeks and weeks and weeks of reading more about kerberos 
than I'd ever care to admit. Otherwise, pretty fun course. I actually really liked the mr job assignment to really see
how mapreduce works. Not a whole lot of spark sql focus so you don't get much insight to how much, say, the sql you'd 
use in postgres vs the sql you'd use in spark would differ, but maybe that's just left to actual experience.

Workload: light/medium

SIADS 521 - Visual Exploration of Data
A natural extension of 505, but now with matplotlib and one assignment in a visualization library of your choice (I 
chose Bokeh). I feel sometimes matplotlib is almost as esoteric as pandas. I generally find all 
visualization based assigments, whether code heavy or otherwise, quite a time sink; you're always looking to fix this 
color, add that legend, rename this title, format the kerning.... and so on and so forth. The final few assignments 
give you a lot of autonomy to choose direction and this will cost you a lot of time if you are a perfectionist. Also,
I think the extra credit available for this course (it varies by cohort) is an even bigger time sink than the actual 
assignments. 

Workload: medium/heavy

SIADS 522 - Information Visualization I
I feel like more of 521, but done in Altair, and more focused on presentation/interaction/interface. A little bit of
writing and analysis involved - you read Tufte's work and the like. A very fun and actually useful course, especially
if you're in a job/position that requires presenting quite a lot of data to third parties.

Workload: medium

SIADS 523 - Communicating Data Science Results
This is definitely something that is a lot easier if you're already used to presenting stuff at work. A lot of emphasis
on style, readability, cohesively combining information in a format for non-quantitative folks. This is a HUGE time sink
because it combines all the costs of building an attractive presentation, doing research, AND presenting (you have to 
submit a 5 minute recording of your presentation) but without a team to help you out. I found this the biggest timesink
of all classes in this program, but it was partly because it was during the height of COVID, but also because I find
making Powerpoint presentations very laborious for the same reasons I find making visualizations very laborious: I am 
always fixing things.

Workload: heavy

SIADS 524 - Presenting Uncertainty

SIADS 532 - Data Mining I
Extremely fun. I honestly don't even remember any real issues with this class because there had been no bugs and the
lecture slides extremely clearcut. Although, I felt Week 4 (edit distance) seemed out of place in the curriculum? Although
it does show up later again. Have to be comfortable with some math, though. Remember finishing this in about a week as 
well. 

Workload: light/medium

SIADS 542 - Supervised Learning
Relatively similar to the data science Umich coursera. Sklearn can be a bit esoteric to start off with but once you get
used to the whole fit/predict paradigm, a lot of sklearn suddenly becomes very easy to parse. Didn't really find this
too difficult, per se.

Workload: light/medium

SIADS 543 - Unsupervised Learning
At this point all of the material in this course was new to me, but did not find the workload much significantly heavier
than what is in 542. A little less zombie like in that the problems are no longer are "here's some data, shove it in to
the classifier and predict away." However, quite a larger emphasis on numpy work so, like, get comfortable with matrix 
math if you can. I took this with 632 and found the workload very doable, although there is definitely lumpiness on 
workload week by week. 

Workload: light/medium

SIADS 591/592 - Milestone I
Largely dependent on your project and partner, so hence probably somewhat valuable to have some insight in these two 
before you  start the milestone. Project workload highly dependent on how ambitious you and your partner
are and how annoying it is to work with your datasets.

Re: oral exam, while I'm (probably) not shy, I'm pretty horrid at thinking on my feet though and mildly socially anxious 
so found the oral exam harder than the project - I generally don't really read from notes even in real life so I find 
this format harder to deal with, in some ways (all 4 of my jupyter notebooks to prep for the 4 topics are 
like... 2-3 paragraphs long at best?). 

Workload: medium

SIADS 601 - Qualitative Inquiry for Data Scientists

SIDAS 611 - Database Architecture and Technology
An extension of 511. Still in Postgres. You get to play with a lot of the cool postgres features that not all dbs have.

Workload: light

SIDAS 622 - Information Visualization II

SIADS 630 - Causal Inference

SIDAS 631 - Experiment Design and Analysis

SIADS 632 - Data Mining II
Extremely fun course. Lots of time series data work! Workload significantly heavier compared to other SIDAS courses so
far, but not so bad that I would make this a single course unless you are still uncomfortable with python programming or
math. Would note that there's a significant amount of non-Pandas programming for this one, so would keep that in mind 
as you assess your own experience. I personally found this course quite a great deal of fun. 

Workload: medium/heavy

SIADS 642 - Deep Learning I

SIADS 643 - Machine Learning Pipelines
The "time I should know how to use Git" course. If you already have a regular dev style background this course should
take you, like, less than an hour or two to get through. I'm not even a dev and I finished this in less than 16 hours 
(this includes the time I slept and went to work). Videos short and to the point, which I actually find
very nice, actually. I actually learned quite a bit in this course, but it is also not a long course.

Workload: light
